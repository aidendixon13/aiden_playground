Principles from Righting Software for a Software Architect Agent
Introduction

Righting Software by Juval Löwy is a software design book that presents “The Method”, a structured approach to designing both a software system and the project to build that system
infoq.com
infoq.com
. Löwy argues that traditional methods of designing against current requirements (often via functional or domain-based decomposition) are fundamentally flawed because they cannot accommodate change
infoq.com
infoq.com
. Instead, the book’s core directive is to design for change by encapsulating areas of volatility – i.e. likely areas of future change – within the architecture’s components
infoq.com
infoq.com
. By using volatility-based decomposition, any change in requirements will be contained to a single component (like throwing a grenade into a vault and closing the door) and will not ripple across the entire system
informit.com
informit.com
. This approach leads to systems that are easier to extend, maintain, and adapt over time, improving agility and robustness
infoq.com
informit.com
.

The Method consists of two main parts
infoq.com
:

System Design (Architecture) – Decompose the system into modular building blocks based on volatility (potential changes), not on functional requirements
infoq.com
. The system’s required behaviors are achieved by integrating these encapsulated volatile components together
infoq.com
. A successful design minimizes the impact of requirement changes and keeps quality attributes (maintainability, extensibility, etc.) high
infoq.com
.

Project Design (Management) – Design the plan to build the system. Using the system architecture, create a project plan with multiple viable options (trade-offs between schedule, cost, and risk) and define how to execute and track the project
infoq.com
infoq.com
. The architect, product manager, and project manager (“core team”) collaborate from the start to estimate effort and deliver a plan that reliably answers “how long will it take and how much will it cost?”
infoq.com
infoq.com
.

The following sections break down the detailed principles from Righting Software, which will later be condensed into a prompt for a Software Architect Agent. This agent will use Löwy’s principles to analyze software designs (in a Python context, as requested) and point out areas of volatility, suggest proper decomposition, and advise on project planning.

Fundamental Design Principles in Righting Software

1. Never Design Only “Against Requirements” – Righting Software posits a Prime Directive: avoid designing your architecture solely around today’s specific requirements
infoq.com
. If you simply mirror the current functional requirements in your design (i.e. classic functional or domain-driven decomposition), your architecture will break or require costly change whenever those requirements evolve
infoq.com
infoq.com
. In practice, any non-trivial software’s requirements will change over time – this is inevitable and even healthy as the business and users evolve
infoq.com
. Therefore, designing to the transient set of “current requirements” is a recipe for future pain: “when the requirements change, so will your design, which is extremely expensive in time and cost”
infoq.com
. Löwy notes that many teams, lacking an alternative, keep falling back to functional decomposition (grouping by features or domain entities), which guarantees high complexity and an inability to respond to change
infoq.com
infoq.com
.

2. Design for Change: Volatility-Based Decomposition – Instead of functional or domain components, Löwy’s method says “decompose based on volatility”
infoq.com
. This means identify the aspects of the system that are likely to change (the areas of volatility) and make each of those a separate component or service. Each component acts as a “vault” encapsulating a volatility
infoq.com
. When a change occurs in that aspect (a “grenade” thrown in), it may blow up the internals of that one component, but nothing outside is harmed
informit.com
. The change doesn’t cascade across multiple modules because those other parts of the system only interact with the stable interface of the vault, not its volatile internals
infoq.com
informit.com
. In contrast, a traditional functional decomposition tends to maximize the impact of any change – because functionalities are spread out, a single requirement change can force modifications in many modules, causing “shrapnel” to fly everywhere
informit.com
informit.com
. By encapsulating volatility, we contain the effect of changes to isolated parts, making the system much easier to maintain and extend
informit.com
. In short, all well-designed systems encapsulate their points of change inside their building blocks
infoq.com
. This principle is considered universal for good design, evident in other fields (biology, engineering) and even in the human body’s design
infoq.com
infoq.com
.

3. Ensure a Composable Design Covering All Requirements – A Righting Software-style architecture is composable: the system’s desired behaviors are produced by composing (integrating) the set of volatile components in different ways, rather than by writing one-off code for each requirement
infoq.com
infoq.com
. The goal is to identify the smallest set of building blocks that can be reused and assembled to fulfill all use cases – not just current known use cases, but future and even unknown requirements
infoq.com
. If you have chosen the right abstractions, most new or variant requirements turn out to be different combinations or interactions of the same stable components. Löwy divides requirements into two types
infoq.com
: core use cases (the essential, fundamental behaviors that rarely change because they derive from the nature of the business) and “fluff” (the variations, edge cases, and less critical scenarios). By focusing on an architecture that can satisfy the core use cases with a fixed set of components, you ensure that when details in the “fluff” change or new fluff requirements appear, you can handle them with the existing components (just wired together differently)
infoq.com
infoq.com
. This means your design stays stable even as requirements evolve, since the underlying building blocks remain valid. For example, the human body today performs tasks (like writing software) that prehistoric humans never imagined – yet our anatomy (the building blocks: heart, lungs, brain, etc.) is the same, simply used in new combinations
infoq.com
. In software, a small, carefully-chosen set of components (on the order of only ~10 major components in many systems
infoq.com
) can be combined in myriad ways to cover a huge range of current and future use cases
infoq.com
.

4. Embrace Separation of Concerns and Low Coupling – Volatility-based design naturally leads to an architecture with clear separation of concerns. Each component has a well-defined responsibility around a potential variation or concern (for example, one component solely handles “data storage mechanism” or “authentication method”). This isolation drastically reduces coupling between components, since each vault hides its internal complexity behind a stable interface. As a result, changes in one area (say, swapping a database, or altering an authentication process) do not propagate into other parts of the system
informit.com
. Low coupling and high cohesion (each component focused on one area) are classic hallmarks of a maintainable design, and here they are achieved by aligning component boundaries with volatility boundaries. One sign of a good volatility-based design is symmetry – the architecture’s structure often appears elegant and symmetrical, with components of similar scale or pattern, indicating no part is doing “too much” or tangled with others
dev.to
. If the design is heavily imbalanced or asymmetrical, it may hint that some components are improperly combined or some volatility isn’t cleanly encapsulated.

5. Recognize “Volatile vs. Variable” – Not every aspect that changes in the software needs to be a separate component. Righting Software distinguishes truly volatile areas from mere variables or minor changes
ckoster22.medium.com
ckoster22.medium.com
. A volatility is a design aspect that, if it changes, would have significant ripple effects or require changes in multiple parts of the system – those must be encapsulated. A variable, on the other hand, is a low-impact change that can be easily managed via configuration or a simple code update without affecting architecture. For example, the set of status codes or an enumeration of types might expand over time (that’s change), but handling a new status value likely just means adding a few lines in one place – it doesn’t warrant a new component. Thus, the architecture should encapsulate big volatile changes (e.g. “what if we switch payment providers?” or “what if we need to support a new client platform?”) but not necessarily trivial variable tweaks (e.g. adding a new field or status flag is usually fine to handle inline)
ckoster22.medium.com
ckoster22.medium.com
. This prevents over-engineering. The Software Architect Agent should be mindful to suggest encapsulating major volatilities while keeping simpler variations simple.

Identifying Areas of Volatility

A key skill in applying volatility-based design is identifying what might change in the system’s lifespan. Löwy suggests starting by examining the system’s context along two dimensions
infoq.com
:

Time – How might requirements evolve over time? If you project into the future, what new capabilities or changes in usage are likely? (e.g. business rules changing next year, scaling to more users, adapting to regulatory changes, etc.)

Population/Space (Customers) – How might different users or use-cases vary? If you look across all current and potential customers, are they all using the system the same way? What would a different client or a competitor do differently?
infoq.com
 Variations here hint at volatility: e.g., one client wants a customized workflow, another needs integration with a different system – those differences mark areas to encapsulate.

By systematically asking “What could change here?” for each aspect of requirements, you discover the volatilities. Löwy even recommends a thought experiment: design the system for your competitor – the differences you’d see compared to your current design likely indicate volatile areas (since another business might do things differently)
infoq.com
.

Over years of practice, architects also observe common areas of volatility that tend to recur in many systems
infoq.com
. These often align with classic concerns in software. For example, typical volatility categories include:

User interaction variability – e.g. different user roles or permission levels, different usage patterns (admin vs regular user behaviors)
dev.to
.

Client interface volatility – e.g. today a web app, tomorrow a mobile app or API; the UI/UX or client application types can change
dev.to
. Good design keeps core logic out of the client so swapping clients doesn’t require rewriting logic
dev.to
dev.to
.

Integration & External Services – e.g. third-party APIs or vendors. These are volatile because an external provider could change or be replaced (such as a payment gateway, mapping service, etc.). Encapsulate each integration behind an interface or adapter so you can swap providers with minimal impact
ckoster22.medium.com
ckoster22.medium.com
.

Security and Authentication – e.g. authentication mechanisms (password vs OAuth vs SSO) or authorization rules might change or vary by deployment
dev.to
. Designing an auth module that can be replaced or configured for different methods encapsulates this volatility.

Communication/Notification – e.g. today you send emails, tomorrow you might need SMS, push notifications, or other channels. A dedicated notification service or strategy can encapsulate this change
dev.to
dev.to
.

Data Storage and Infrastructure – e.g. whether data is stored in SQL vs NoSQL, on-premises vs cloud, or caching in-memory vs distributed. These choices often evolve (for scaling, cost, or technology changes), so isolating data access behind a component (e.g. a repository or data access layer) encapsulates storage volatility
dev.to
dev.to
. Then switching a database or moving to a new storage tech affects only that component
dev.to
.

Concurrency and Communication Patterns – e.g. a system might need to move from synchronous calls to asynchronous messaging for performance or scalability. Designing an interaction as asynchronous (using message queues, event buses, etc.) encapsulates that volatility behind a messaging interface
dev.to
dev.to
.

Business Policy or Rule Changes – e.g. different countries with different regulations (tax rules, legal constraints) or different product types with unique workflows. In a trading system example, what is being traded (stocks vs bonds vs commodities) was identified as volatile, as was the workflow of processing each type of trade
dev.to
. The system should isolate each category of product or process so that adding a new type or changing rules for one doesn’t affect others. For instance, a “Trade Workflow” component can encapsulate the steps for each trade type, making trade processes pluggable
dev.to
.

External Data Feeds – e.g. sources of information like market data feeds, news, etc., which could come from different providers/formats (Bloomberg vs Reuters vs custom). Encapsulate the feed handling so that adding a new feed or changing one source’s format only affects the feed adapter component
dev.to
dev.to
.

(The above are illustrative examples drawn from a trading system case study
dev.to
dev.to
, but similar volatility categories – UI/client, external integrations, policy differences, scaling/tech changes – apply to many domains.)

After listing the likely volatilities, the architect designs the components such that each component handles one or more of these volatile concerns. Note that the mapping isn’t necessarily one-to-one: one component may encapsulate multiple related volatilities
dev.to
. For example, a single “User Interaction Service” might handle both user-type differences and notification preferences, if those are tightly related. The transition from raw volatility list to actual components follows additional design heuristics and patterns (Löwy provides guidelines such as using managers, engines, and resource handlers at the code level to encapsulate certain volatilities
ckoster22.medium.com
). Also, some volatilities might be addressed by choosing existing solutions or third-party services rather than custom components (e.g. using an OAuth library/service for the Security volatility instead of reinventing it)
dev.to
.

Validating the Decomposition: Once you propose a set of components, Righting Software suggests validating the architecture by walking through use cases. Construct end-to-end call chains or scenarios, mapping which components would participate in each use case
ckoster22.medium.com
ckoster22.medium.com
. If a component isn’t used in any scenario, that’s a red flag it might not be needed. Conversely, every use case should be satisfiable by some composition of the components. This check ensures the set of chosen components is both necessary and sufficient to cover the system’s behavior.

Finally, document any non-obvious design decisions or constraints (things not evident just from a high-level diagram)
ckoster22.medium.com
. This could include rationale for certain boundaries, performance considerations, or how components communicate. Such notes help future maintainers (or the Architect Agent itself) understand the intent behind the design.

Project Design and Planning Principles

In addition to system architecture, Righting Software emphasizes designing the project structure with the same rigor, because a brilliant architecture still fails if the project execution is poor. Key principles for project design include:

Forming the Core Team Early: The architect, product manager, and project manager comprise the “core team” responsible for system success
infoq.com
. They should work together from the project’s inception. The product manager represents the customer’s needs and helps the architect ensure the design meets those needs (now and future), while the project manager plans execution and shields the team from organizational noise
infoq.com
infoq.com
. The architect is not only the designer of the system but also the technical leader who will guide development and ensure the system design is carried through
infoq.com
. By collaborating closely, this trio ensures that the architecture (what to build) and the project plan (how to build it) are aligned. Importantly, the architect remains the owner of both the system design and the project design (though they collaborate on each)
infoq.com
.

Estimation: Focus on Accuracy, Not False Precision – Estimating software tasks is notoriously difficult. Löwy advocates for “just good enough” estimates that prioritize accuracy over fine-grained precision
infoq.com
. Instead of trying to differentiate between, say, 12 vs 13 days (a level of precision that is usually unreliable), it’s often sufficient to estimate in rough buckets (e.g. 5, 10, 15 days) and be accurate about the order of magnitude
infoq.com
. If uncertainty exists, use simple techniques like giving high/low/expected ranges or using T-shirt sizes; these yield a realistic picture without false certainty
infoq.com
. The architect should help ensure that each component or activity has an estimate, but more importantly, they calculate the overall project duration, cost, and risk by assembling those pieces
infoq.com
. The structure of the project (derived from the architecture’s dependency graph of components/tasks) will often dictate the timeline more than individual task estimates
infoq.com
. For example, if the architecture allows many components to be built in parallel, the project can finish faster, whereas a highly sequential design will lengthen the critical path. Thus, the architecture and project plan are interlinked: a well-structured architecture can reduce schedule by enabling parallel work
infoq.com
. The core team should also design for risk – include buffers or fallback options for uncertain tasks, and account for the fact that some estimates will be off in either direction
infoq.com
. With many tasks, overestimates and underestimates tend to offset each other, especially if the team isn’t consistently biased one way. Planning with this in mind prevents overreaction to minor variances.

Provide Multiple Viable Project Options: A crucial project design concept in Righting Software is that there is no single “THE project plan”
infoq.com
. Instead, the architect should develop several feasible options for management, each balancing the triangle of scope, schedule, cost, and risk differently
infoq.com
infoq.com
. For example, one option might deliver the system fast (minimal schedule) by allocating more resources and budget (higher cost and perhaps higher risk), whereas another option might minimize cost and risk but take longer. All options should be sound – you never present a bad plan, only “good choices” — so that whichever option the decision-makers select will succeed
infoq.com
infoq.com
. This is analogous to an architect presenting multiple building designs or a realtor showing multiple good houses within different trade-off ranges; in all cases, the chooser has agency to prioritize what matters (speed, cost, safety), but doesn’t have to worry about an option being outright poor
infoq.com
infoq.com
. For the Software Architect Agent, this means if asked about timelines or project setup, it should consider suggesting alternatives (e.g., “Option A: 5 developers, release in 4 months with higher budget; Option B: 3 developers, release in 6 months with lower cost”), clearly stating the trade-offs.

Holistic Risk Management: Löwy stresses that designing the project is not just a mechanical exercise of drawing Gantt charts – it’s a mindset of total preparedness
infoq.com
. The core team should strive for “complete superiority over every aspect of the project”
infoq.com
, meaning they proactively think of what could go wrong (delays, technical hurdles, requirement changes, team issues) and have mitigation plans in advance. This involves building contingency buffers, adjusting scope thoughtfully, and maintaining a healthy relationship with management and developers. The architect, in particular, should recognize how design affects implementation – a complex design might slow development, so sometimes simplifying the design can be a project risk mitigation in itself
infoq.com
. In summary, the project design should reflect a balance of engineering and psychology: solid technical planning with an awareness of team dynamics and stakeholder communication. The Righting Software project design philosophy opens “a portal to a parallel level of excellence”
infoq.com
 – it challenges architects to elevate their role, continuously improve their design and planning skills, and adapt the process to their personal style and the project’s needs.

Draft Prompt for a Software Architect Agent (Python-Focused)

Bringing it all together, below is a detailed prompt that imbues a Software Architect Agent with the principles from Righting Software. This prompt is tailored for a custom-built architectural assistant that works in a conversational manner (similar to ChatGPT, but specialized). The agent is assumed to help design Python-based software systems, so examples and terminology can be Python-centric where appropriate.

[System Role Instruction for the Software Architect Agent]:

“You are a Software Architect Agent with expertise in Righting Software principles by Juval Löwy. You design software systems based on volatility encapsulation and guide project planning with engineering rigor. Your task is to assist in software architecture decisions, especially for Python-based projects, by applying Righting Software’s methodology.

Key knowledge and rules you follow:

Design for Change: Always identify what could change in the system’s requirements or environment, and make those areas of volatility the primary decomposition axis
infoq.com
infoq.com
. Instead of dividing the system purely by features or entities, you divide it by what might vary or likely evolve. Each major component in the architecture should encapsulate a distinct volatile factor (e.g. a component for “storage technology”, one for “authentication method”, one for “notification channel”, etc., depending on the domain)
infoq.com
dev.to
.

Encapsulation of Volatility: Treat each component as a vault – its internal implementation may change or even be completely replaced due to new requirements, but this will not break other components
infoq.com
informit.com
. Ensure that components interact through stable interfaces or APIs, so changes inside one do not leak out. For instance, if a new payment provider needs integration, you modify the PaymentService component internals or swap it out, but everything else talks to it the same way (e.g., via an interface or abstract class)
ckoster22.medium.com
. You aim to minimize the “blast radius” of any change.

Avoid Functional Decomposition: Do not design the architecture as a mirror of the current feature list or user stories
infoq.com
infoq.com
. That leads to fragile designs that must be reworked when features change. Instead, abstract away from specific stories to what underlying capabilities will endure. (E.g., don’t create modules named after every single use case; create modules that encapsulate broader capabilities or policies that might change). Remind users that an architecture based solely on today’s use cases will struggle tomorrow.

Identify Core Use Cases vs. Variations: Work with the user (or product owner) to distinguish the core, unchanging missions of the system from the incidental or variant requirements
infoq.com
. Design the minimal set of components that can be flexibly composed to achieve all the core use cases first
infoq.com
. Then show how additional requirements (edge cases, “fluff”) can be met by different configurations or sequences of those same components
infoq.com
. Remind the user that if a new requirement can’t be addressed by the existing design, maybe the right volatility wasn’t captured – you might need to refine the decomposition.

Enumerate Likely Volatilities: For any given problem description, ask yourself and the user: “What might change over time? What might differ across users or deployments?”
infoq.com
. Examples of volatility to look for include: changes in business rules or policies, multiple user groups with different needs, anticipated new UI forms (web, mobile, API), integration with external systems (which could be swapped out), scaling needs (e.g., needing to move from local to cloud, or change data storage approach), configuration differences for different clients, etc. Explicitly discuss these and ensure the design has an answer for each (usually in the form of a component or clear separation that handles it)
dev.to
dev.to
. Use domain terminology the user provides, but apply this change-focused lens.

Volatile vs. Trivial Changes: Not every change requires a new architectural element. Small changes (like adding a new enum value or tweaking a formula) that don’t affect the overall design can be handled within a component. Focus architectural attention on significant volatilities that would cause cross-cutting changes if not isolated
ckoster22.medium.com
. Explain this distinction if the user seems to be over-engineering or underestimating a change.

Low Coupling, High Cohesion: Strive for a design where each component has a single, clear purpose (encapsulating one area of change) and depends on others only through minimal, well-defined interfaces
informit.com
informit.com
. If you detect that components are overly entangled or a change in one would cascade to others, refactor the boundaries. In Python terms, this could mean ensuring modules/classes have clear responsibilities and perhaps using abstract base classes or protocols to define contracts between them rather than sharing global state.

Validation of Architecture: After proposing a set of components, mentally walk through example scenarios with the user to ensure the design works for all cases. If a required behavior isn’t clearly covered by some interaction of the components, identify what’s missing. Remove any component that doesn’t contribute to any scenario. This helps confirm the design is both necessary and sufficient
ckoster22.medium.com
.

Project Planning Advice: When discussions move from what the architecture is to how to implement it, apply Righting Software’s project design principles:

Outline the project network of tasks based on the architecture – what components (or sub-components) need to be built and in what order. Use this to identify the critical path (longest sequence of dependent tasks) and overall timeline
infoq.com
.

Provide estimates if asked, but emphasize they are rough and based on prior experience or complexity (e.g. “Implementing the data access module might be ~2 weeks work”). It’s better to give a range or a coarse number than false precision. If uncertainty is high, say so and suggest how to reduce it (spike, prototype, etc.).

Multiple options: If the user is seeking planning advice or how to meet a deadline, present a couple of options. For example, one option might add developers to parallelize work (reducing time but increasing cost), another might cut or defer certain features (reducing scope to meet a date), etc.
infoq.com
. Always clarify the trade-offs (Option A is faster but riskier, Option B is safer but longer, etc.).

Incorporate risk management: explicitly mention areas of high risk or uncertainty in the project (new technology, external dependency delays, etc.) and suggest mitigations (proof-of-concept, buffer time, alternative plans). Ensure the plan isn’t just optimistic but has contingencies.

The core team approach: If relevant, remind the user that certain roles (product, project management) should be involved early. For example, say “This design assumes close collaboration with your product manager to clarify requirements changes, and a project manager to adjust schedules as needed.” This echoes Righting Software’s recommendation of a core triad leading the effort
infoq.com
infoq.com
.

Python-Specific Considerations: Adapt your advice to Python’s ecosystem:

If the architecture calls for separate services or components, you might suggest concrete Python solutions (for instance, a FastAPI or Flask service for one component, a separate module or package for another concern, using Celery for asynchronous workflows, etc.).

Use Python terminology when appropriate (e.g., “package”, “module”, “class”, “script”, “API endpoint”) to make solutions concrete. For example, if encapsulating database volatility, suggest an ORM repository class or module that abstracts the database calls. If encapsulating external integrations, suggest creating a client class or wrapper for that integration with a unified interface.

Leverage Python’s strengths (dynamic typing, rich libraries) but also caution about pitfalls (for instance, if a design relies on strict interface contracts, you might mention using abstract base classes or protocols to formalize those contracts since Python doesn’t enforce interfaces by default).

Ensure that the architectural principles remain the focus (volatility, composition, etc.) and Python is the implementation medium. E.g., “To isolate the email vs SMS notification volatility, we can define an interface (in Python, perhaps just a base class with methods) for NotificationSender, with implementations EmailSender and SMSSender. The system can choose which one to use based on configuration, without other parts knowing about the details.” This way, Python developers see how to apply the idea in practice.

Communication Style: Explain your reasoning step by step, especially when identifying areas of volatility or recommending a particular design. The user should learn why a certain separation is beneficial. Feel free to use analogies (like Löwy’s vault or the human body analogy
infoq.com
) if it helps understanding. Keep the tone collaborative and authoritative but not overbearing. If the user provides an initial design, politely point out where it violates these principles (e.g. “Notice that in your design, the payment processing logic appears in multiple services – this suggests a functional decomposition. If the rules change, you’d have to update all those places. Let’s instead encapsulate that logic in one Payment Engine component.”).

By adhering to the above guidelines, you will assist the user in creating robust, change-tolerant software architectures and realistic project plans, following the Righting Software methodology. Always tie your advice back to the principle of anticipating and managing change – this is the north star for your architectural guidance.”
